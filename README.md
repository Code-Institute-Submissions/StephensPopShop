# Stephens Pop Shop - Fourth Milestone Project for Code Institute

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/jjackson19862017/StephensPopShop.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/jjackson19862017/StephensPopShop)

**[Live Site](https://stephenspopshop.herokuapp.com/ "Heroku App")**

For my Fourth and Final Milestone Project have choosen to build a project based on an auction website involving Pop!Vinyl's.  The goal of the website is for the Owner to advertise his Pop!Vinyl collection and sell them to the public involving either bidding for items or buying them out-right. I will set up an authentication and authorisation.  Where only registered users can bid and buy items that are up for auction. When the buyers come to purchase their goods, they will be using the Stripe Payment Method.

## Project Brief

- Earn money on selling the toys known as Pop!Vinyl's (the site owner is the seller)
- Create an online store focused on selling Pop!Vinyl's, from different series to the highest bidder.
- Allow users to search for Pop!Vinyl's based on various fields.
- Allow users to see the price, image and other basic details about an Pop!Vinyl.
- Allow users to bid on items, or pay a higher price to purchase them immediately. Users have to be registered for this.

## UX

This website is designed for an Owner to provide end-users with Products to either Bid on or Buy straight out.

So I have setup a Products page that end-users can see what the Owner is selling, I have also setup an Auction side.  The Owner can start seven day auctions, or cancel them.

There is also a cart that end-users can change depending on how many Products they want.  They can then goto the Checkout to pay, via Stripe.

There is also a Checkout for the winning bids.

- As a end-user I want to be able to bid or buy a product
  - I will like to see the products:
    - Name
    - Image.
    - Description

- As a end-user I want to have control over my account.
  - I will like to see a button that will allow me sign in or register to use the application easily.
  - I will want a form to be displayed to me so I can imput my details at registration.
  - Once I register, I'll like to be get a message that informs me of success/error
  - I will like the app to store and secure my details, where I can have access to it at anytime.
  - I will like to see a link to my Profile available to me.

- As a registered user I want the ability to raise my bid in ongoing auctions.
  - In auctions, I'll like to see start and end time of auction.
  - While in auctions I want to be able to see an input field and a button that allows me to raise my bid price.
  - I'll like the bid I raised saved and if anyone increase bid I will see the last bid amount.

- As a registered user I want to be able to monitor my bid and make payment when auction has ended.
  - I also want to see a message to inform me of the auction status.
  - When auction has ended or won, I want a payment option to display to me
  - When I click the button I want it to display a page that takes my payment from me only when auction is won or ends.

- As a user I want to able to see an acknowledgement that I made payment.

While I was doing my testing, I thought about CRUD.  Am I filling all the criteria.

- Create
  - Users
  - Products
  - Auctions
  - Bids

- Read
  - Users
  - Products
  - Auctions
  - Bids

- Update
  - Auctions
  - Bids

- Delete

    - When this button is clicked it will place a bid and won't allow the same user to bid until another user increases the bid.
    - Button in Auctions allows user to increase bid.
- Search Box
  - Search makes it possible to filter search base on product name or artefact category. Search can ony be seen when user is authenticated.
- Forms
  - Allows user to sign in and sign up. Also allows user to trigger a button actions
- PayButton
  - Allows user to make payment when auction is over. This button appears when auction is ended
- StripeJS
  - StripeJS payment used is to take payment from the web app from only an auction winner.
  - StripeJS payment used is to take payment from the web app from an end-user that wants to purchase an Item straight away.
- Profile
  - Allows user to view their details when signed into the app.

### Wireframes

Please see the folder called Wireframes.

### Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)

- Allow registered users to write reviews about the Pop!Vinyl's, only if they purchased them.
- Expand the search functionality to allow users to sort results based on price, character and other parameters in both ascending and descending order.
- Include pagination and/or other dynamic display actions using javascript or bootstrap.
- Use javascript polling to update the page whenever there's a new bid.
- Allow the owner to easily remove Products instead of going through the admin section.

## Travis Testing

Open the Travis at travis-ci.org then click to sign in with GitHub. Once you are signed in, locate settings at the top right dropdown arrown. Once you are inside settings, you'll see list of all GitHub repositories, you then need to find GitHub repositories for the specific app and switch it on. If the repositories has been switched on, then go to top of our page, copy markdown text and paste at the bottom of our README.md file. After this, create a .travis.yml file to configure our travis settings language, python version, installer, script into..

Then we can add, commit and push all our changes to GitHub then we can now check if tests are passing or failing. By default Travis is updated along when we push our commits into GitHub

- Tested on Chrome (Tested in DevOps on all mobile and tablet devices possible for testing.)
- Tested on Ipad
- Tested on Firefox (Tested in DevOps on all mobile and tablet devices possible for testing.)
- Tested on Safari (Tested in DevOps on all mobile and tablet devices possible for testing.)

## Deployment

### AWS3 Deployment Process

Created a new Amazon account and connect to amazon service AWS3 account are cloud based serve where the project media and staicfiles will be stored unto. At first, we locate S3 on amazon service then we create a bucket. While creating the bucket on S3, the note that public access must be all switched off to allow access for users.

Once we've created the bucket, we now can now click on it's properties and enable the Static Website Hosting option, so it can serve the purpose of hosting our static files, you will need to imput an index.html and error.html before saving. Then we go into the created bucket Permissions and click into CORS configuration, this part already have a prefilled default config, All that is needed is just to write the default code and save the config.

Then we go into the bucket policy to allows access to the contents across all web and inside this we will put in here some code including arn address displayed at the top of the heading. Then we go into amazon IAM to allow identity and access management of our stored files and folder. In the IAM service, we add a new group for our application and then we set the policies to ALL Then it generates a downlaodable zip file containing ID and KEY for us to use for the newly added group. This ID and KEY as to be stored in an environment variable.

This then allows us to into our terminal window and install some settings Boto3 Django Storages

The Django Storages is passed into the installed apps in settings and also a custom_storage file is created to store credentials in environment variable. And once everything looks fine we can run python3 manage.py collectstatic. This will collect all the static files in our app including any changes that is made. N.B this command has to be run in the development(local) environment each time a change is been made in the static files/folder And your folder and files should display in your *AWS3 BUCKETS

### GitHub Deployment

Created a new repositories on Github where the project will be deployed unto at each commit. At first, use a git remote command to link project with new repo. Then use the git push -u origin master command to push codes and every change into new repo

Using the CLI in terminal to call git init to start git initialization on the project. This allows a file/files to be added to the Github repo by calling a git add command. Then any added file/files is being commited with a git commit -m "commit message" command. Afterwards, the file is been pushed with git push where Github username + password is required. Once successful, code will be deployed into your repo and git status command should indicate branch tree clean.

### Heroku Deployment

Created a new app on Heroku where the app is hosted live. At first, to allow Heroku locate application we login into the CLI using **heroku login -i** command. You will be requested to imput username and password for Heroku account. After which you can request Heroku Apps via CLI.

Knowing the apps you need to pass deployment into then we can use heroku git:remote -a to allow Git automatically update deployment in Heroku. Once this has been remotely passed . To host the app unto heroku pass the IP and PORT config to match the route main config.

To allow PostgresSQL, we have to go into our newly created app and click into resources inside here you can type PostgresSQL and add as an add on, it should prompt up on your screen choose the hobby dev free and click on provision. Once you allow PostgresSQL it will generate a DATABASE_URL in the heroku settings.

Now we need to install in production terminal dj-database-url and psycopg2 Then we run a migrate to to update our new PostgresSQL database and since this is new in Heroku, all data imputed will be erased. Which means we need to createsuperuser from terminal and add our contents again, Our new production database is ready. So we can rebuild all our projects again.

To allow git to push to heroku the command git push heroku master must be called for a final push. For a succefull and healthy push it is best adviced to have the requirement.txt and Procfile files installed or updated. Most especially for requirement.txt file which gave me a lot of challenges, it requires to be updated along with any installed packages so it can depoly successfully, i.e Flask packages.

### HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, Python(Django Framework)

All my mark up is HTML valid All my styling is CSS valid All my syntax is JavaScript syntactically valid All my routing, views and urls is Django valid

### Version Used

I use GitHub for version control. Which backup my code incase I encounter a bug or an error that needs urgent fix or restoration. I can easily traceback my code on GitHub to changes applied and versions updates.

## Places I Have Looked For Help

## Timeline

This is my fourth milestone and ironically my fourth attempt.

As this is my fourth attempt I will include links to my previous attempts that can be found at

- <https://github.com/jjackson19862017/PopWorld>
- <https://github.com/jjackson19862017/popworld2>
- <https://github.com/jjackson19862017/popworld3>

I will be using previous code, from my past attempts to save me time. As I only have 3 days to complete this project and submit it in for assessment.  
I have started again, has I was trying to be clever and do everything in my head. I realise my tables could be managed and designed better. I actually went old school and wrote my tables out and drew the links. Visually seeing it was better for me to understand where I could of gone wrong previously.

### Thursday 26th March 2020

Started project for a fourth time, going to commit my readme.md and env.py and gitignore as my --> "Initial Commit".

Time to create my project called "popshop", and change the settings file to hide hidden keys etc.

I will also create the static and media folder structure.

--> "Project Setup"

Create accounts for users.

Created Superuser

--> "Accounts App Created"

Create Products app for Products to populate with.

Created Templates folder as I forgot to do that when I was creating my static folder.

--> "Products App Created"

Create Search app for users to search for potential products.

--> "Search App Created"

Create Cart app for users to buy products.

--> "Cart App Created"

Create Checkout app for users to make payments.

--> "Checkout App Created"

Create Auction app for the owner to create auctions.

--> "Auction App Created"

Create Bids app for the users to bid on auctions.

--> "Bid App Created"

So now I am back to where I started however there are a few adjustments I have to make due to the fields changing tables.

Also got rid of home redirect as I am not using a home app this time around.

--> "Field Updates"

While building and testing my website, I have found it annoying to remember who I am logged in as, so I have modified the base.html to run an if statement to see if I am a superuser.  If that is true then the navbar will turn Red.

I have also moved around the links on the navbar.

--> "Navbar Update"

I thought it would be some nice feedback for the user, if the loops were empty.  Ie no products or auctions.  I found the solution on <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/templates/builtins/>

I also changed the way the cart and checkout looks, they now appear as tables so it looks like an invoice.

--> "Empty Lists UI Update"

I have found a problem with paying for things with Stripe so I am watching the videos again.

My jquery and the stripe js was being loaded out of order.

--> "Fixed Stripe Payments"

I have changed everything from Pop World to Pop Shop.

I have also hidden the cart if it is empty.  This is to stop people from openning an empty cart.

--> "Shop Update"

I have got the bids to work with the new field in the other table

--> "Bids Working"

### Saturday 28th March 2020

I tried to see if I could display my bid data on my auction site, however after many tries.  I created a field in the auction model that is updated by the open_auction

--> "Auction Models Updated"

Updated some links, and changed the base.html to reflect open and closed auctions.

Researched Countdown Timers for JS <https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_countdown>

Unfortunately can't get it to work at the present time, will focus on the task I have been putting off and thats getting my winning bid to purchase.

Im so close to getting it working, just need some help.

--> "Nearly there with putting a winning bid into a cart"

I have spent nearly 2 hours looking on how to put this PRICE from add_to_cart view into the cart_contents context

Thank you Anne and Tim about sessions, I have got further now

--> "Session Price"

### Sunday 29th March 2020

Updated the Bid.html, to reflect if you have won the auction or not and if you have gives you the chance to pay for your win.
Updated the auction.html, to reflect if you have placed the highest bid or not and if you losing the auction, it gives you chance to bid again.

Updated the views.py in auction to reflect what user has placed a bid.

Tested my new changes with logging in as different users and seeing the outcome on the website.

--> "Bidding Winner Updated"

The Winning Bid button adds, the winning bid to a cart and sends you to a winning bid checkout.

--> "Winner to Checkout"

I now need to figure out is how to delete, an auction once its been won and paid for???

I have also found a problem with my cart as it only allows one newprice, so if there were multiple items in the cart they would all get the same price.

--> "Problems"

### Monday 30th March 2020

Fixed the code so that either Products and Winning Bids will goto the cart.

The only issue, which I know I dont have time to fix is that you can't mix the two types of products, because otherwise the cart won't display the right prices.

--> "Bids and Products Purchasing Working"

Updated the Winning Bid Checkout on looks and modified the Models.

--> "Checkout Update"

Updated the HTML to be more friendly for smaller devices.

--> "UX Friendly"

Updated the Bidcheckout with the ability to delete auctions on successul payments.

My first test deleted all auctions, however in my haste I had selected all auctions.  So I confined my parameters to product id's.

Done

--> "Auction Deleting"

Fixed Two Decimal place in newprice from bidding.

When you open auctions it searches for any closed auctions and changes them to closed, so the user only sees open ones.

--> "Tweaks"

While on Call with Mentor my checkout payment method broke, hes the fix.

--> "Checkout Fixed"

IDEA: Allowing the owner to delete any auctions that he wants to, just incase they have made an error or theres a stock error.

Complete IDEA

--> "Cancel Auction Button"

IDEA: change widget for date and time selector.

I googled a date time picker, I have saved it for now but I dont really like it.

### Tuesday 31st March 2020

I have found a better date time picker, <https://pypi.org/project/django-bootstrap-datepicker-plus/>

Unfortunately couldnt get it working so Plan C <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3367091/whats-the-cleanest-simplest-to-get-running-datepicker-in-django/49064892>

Plan D would work either, you would think that using the in-built date picker would work but NO.

I have spent nearly 6 hours looking for a date picker, to no success.  So instead of the User making an error inputing the date and time.  I have just set a 7 day auction.

--> "Seven Day Auction"

When I tried to log out of my user there came an error about "conversion from dict to Decimal is not supported".

This was the code that was entered when I fixed my decimal and rounding.

So I have created a fix for it.

I have also commented on my code for easy reading.

--> "Decimal Fix, Code Commenting"

Now commenting on code inside my django project and testing anything that needs testing.

#### Create

### Friday 3rd April 2020

I am finishing my project today, so I have updated my Readme file.

I have also realised I have forgotton a few things.

- My buttons in my footer dont work.
- If your not logged in you can still add things to cart.  I need to change that.
- Also my cart needs some instructions for end-users.
